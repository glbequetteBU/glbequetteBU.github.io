BOO!!! I hope I scared you!!!! Happy Halloween Sweetheart!!! I hope you have a good morning and day today! I know you're gonna be up late drinking and being scared with Ryan but please just be responsible, I love you and I care about you more than you know and I just want you to be okay.

Joke Of The Day: Why don’t skeletons ever go trick-or-treating alone?

Because they don’t have the guts!
